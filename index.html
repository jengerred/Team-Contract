    <h1>CISP 111 - Working as a Team</h1>
    <p class="H2">TEAMWORK PROCEDURES</p>
    <p class="blue"><i>1.  Assign members of your group roles and responsibilities.  They might be similar to those below:</i></p>

    <p><b>Role:</b> <u>Team Project Manager (required)</u></p>
    <p><b>Responsibilities:</b> Setting agenda, making sure weekly tasks and minutes are assigned and completed, conducting meetings, and holding members accountable.</p>
<br/>

    <p><b>Role:</b> <u>Team Project Editor</u></p>
    <p><b>Responsibilities:</b> gathering the parts of the project and turning them into a unified document, editing files, giving rewriting suggestions and tasks to other members, acting on team members editing comments, and final rewriting and/or assembly of the document.</p>
    <br/>

    <p><b>Role:</b> <u>Team Project Administrator</u></p>
    <p><b>Responsibilities:</b>Typing up minutes, checking for completion of assigned tasks by deadline, turning in agenda and checklist weekly, and bringing required documents/files to class electronically.</p>
<br/>

    <p><b>Role:</b> <u>PowerPoint Manager/Proofreader</u></p>
    <p><b>Responsibilities:</b>Creating MS PowerPoint and MS Project/MS Visio diagrams and charts from other members’ input as well as proofreading edited version for typos prior to deadlines.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Note: These are just suggestions.  Most teams will find a system that works best for them.  Teams can also rotate positions as well as share responsibilities. Above all, the team needs to collaborate, be good listeners, and review documents together.  Make sure you help each other complete tasks.</p>
<br/>

<p class="blue"><i>2.	Follow a weekly schedule.</i></p>
<p>To ensure the appropriate level of collaboration and discussion for group reporting, teams should either hold weekly meetings outside of class and/or communicate via Blackboard communication tools.  During each meeting, the team will assign weekly tasks to each team member.  Minutes will summarize what was discussed, what actions were taken, and what task each member will do.  It is the team member’s responsibility to review and complete these tasks prior to the next meeting.  The weekly agenda and minutes will be posted in Blackboard’s group section to be viewed by all members.  Team members’ performance will be evaluated based on the agenda and minutes.  These will indicate what tasks were assigned to each team member and whether he/she complete these tasks on time as well as participating in the collaborative process actively.  The minute taker should sign his/her name to the document.</p>
<p>If you follow these steps, you will have better success with defining your objectives and setting a schedule.  </p>

<h1>CISP 111 - Team Contract</h1>
<p>Team-based work assignments provide students with the opportunity to collaborate in accomplishing goals.  This is very similar to accomplishing projects in a work environment.  Therefore, team members must take their individual roles, responsibilities, and contributions to their team’s success very seriously.  Team expectations should include the following:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Responsiveness</b> – Each member is expected to participate in agreed-upon group discussions and meetings (this includes returning emails and/or phone calls promptly (within 24 hours).</li>
    <li><b>Timeliness</b> – Each member is expected to complete his/her assigned tasks on or before the deadlines set by the group.</li>
    <li><b>Quality/Quantity </b> – Each member is expected to submit work in the quantity and quality expected of this level of course. The instructor will evaluate each individual’s work based on the quality of the final project, participation, and feedback (peer evaluation) from team members.</li>
    <li><b>Cooperation</b> – Each member is expected to contribute to the decisions of the group.</li>
    <li><b>Impact of Peer Evaluations</b> – It is important that the final performance review of the team members accurately and honestly represents the peers’ contributions. <b>This evaluation addressed to the instructor is strictly confidential.</b></li>
    </ul>

<p><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> – The consequences for failing to fulfill team expectations will lower the final course grade by at least one-half letter grade, (since 20% of the course grade is based on the team project.)</p>
<p><b>ACCEPTANCE</b> (Review and Sign):</p>
    <ul class="tab-li">
        <li>I understand that I am obligated to abide by these terms and conditions.</li>
        <li>I understand that if I do not abide by these terms and conditions, I am subject to the consequences stated in this contract.</li>
        <li>I understand that the Team Project assignment must be completed and submitted by the deadline.  I further understand that members are expected to reassign tasks not completed by the originally assigned member, to ensure that all project components are completed and submitted on time.</li>
    </ul>
